## Directory Overview

### 1. **Basic-Programs**  
Contains fundamental C programs focusing on basic syntax, loops, conditions, and input/output operations. Ideal for beginners starting with C.

### 2. **Dynamic-Data-Structure**  
Programs that implement dynamic memory management and data structures like linked lists, stacks, queues, and trees.

### 3. **Graphs**  
Covers fundamental graph algorithms, including traversal techniques like BFS (Breadth-First Search) and DFS (Depth-First Search).

### 4. **Linked List**  
Implementation of singly, doubly, and circular linked lists with operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal.

### 5. **Practice-Programs**  
A variety of solved practice problems to strengthen programming logic and skills.

### 6. **Queue**  
Programs for implementing queue operations using both static arrays and dynamic memory, along with circular queue implementations.

### 7. **Search-Linear-Binary**  
Demonstrates linear and binary search algorithms for efficient data searching techniques.

### 8. **Searching**  
Advanced searching techniques and related problem-solving implementations.

### 9. **Sorting Algorithms**  
Programs for popular sorting algorithms, including bubble sort, insertion sort, selection sort, merge sort, and quicksort.

### 10. **Sorting**  
Additional examples and variations of sorting algorithms with a focus on optimization and complexity analysis.

### 11. **Stack**  
Covers stack implementation using arrays and linked lists, along with common stack-based problems.

### 12. **Static-Data-Structure**  
Programs related to static data structures like arrays and matrices.

### 13. **String-Library-Functions**  
Demonstrates the use of built-in string library functions for tasks like concatenation, comparison, and manipulation.

### 14. **String-Function-Implementation**  
Custom implementations of common string functions such as `strlen`, `strcpy`, `strcat`, and more.

### 15. **Trees**  
Programs implementing tree data structures, including binary trees, binary search trees (BST), and traversal algorithms like inorder, preorder, and postorder.
